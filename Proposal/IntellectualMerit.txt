Traditional BCI game applications use EEG as another communication device similar to a mouse or keyboard. Many EEG applications for business focus around the long term state of the brain. Our project targets the intersection of these two system types by using short term brain state as the trigger and game effects as the feedback. This specialized type of system can act as a training platform for your brain while still being enjoyable for the user.
