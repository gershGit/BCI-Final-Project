Our Brain Computer Interface (BCI) informed game relies on self regulation of alpha waves to inform a gamewide experience. Using the high stress nature gaming induces allows us to exercise the users brain by encouraging them to relax and gain control of their brain waves. As the user regulates their brain activity the game will become easier, while unregulated sporadic brain activity will make the game more challenging. Employing techniques to smooth electroencephalogram (EEG) data such as sliding averages will allow the game to maintain a sense of responsiveness while not reacting to large changes too quickly in order to avoid jarring effects of a rapidly changing in game environment. Though this project focuses on gaming the model is easily transferred to a direct brain training exercise. Using a score metric for how often the player was able to maintain the desired state allows the users to attempt to improve on subsequent runs of the application. This is in addition to an overall score such as the amount of time to complete a task or number of tasks completed within an alloted time.
