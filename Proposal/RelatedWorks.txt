BCI for Games: A ‘State of the Art’ Survey:
- Research has been done into BCI for Games which finds that one of the advantages is early adoption.[REF] This is desirable for our project as it shows that though other types of applications may solve more critical problems, a gaming application is more likely generate interest and be tested by others. Due to the ability to generalize the tasks we ask the user to do in our game, this allows our work to then be applied to more critical areas of research.

EEG-based continuous control of a game using a 3 channel motor imagery BCI: BCI game:
- Our application does not employ the use of motor imagery for control, however research into continuous control using motor imagery still gives us insights into real time control systems using BCI.[REF] The processing of the real time system in their paper employs multiple steps of different neural networks to converge on a final control to be sent to the game. Most important to our work is the use of predictive models as we likely won't design new neural networks for our application. Using predicted values could help us smoothly transition a game-wide variable towards its next value with less bounce back.

Experiencing BCI Control in a Popular Computer Game:
- Other work has been done on modifying current popular titles to use BCI and finding the best way for a user to interact with the game for long periods of time.[REF] Of particular interest to us is how actions were decided. Using a normalized range of frequencies they then used one standard deviation in either direction as threshold values for when an action should take effect. This control scheme can help inform our game on how to use thresholds to avoid jarring and sudden changes. In Addition, one of the primary results of the paper was that BCI did not have an adverse effect on how long an individual would want to play a game which could be a concern when having to wear a headset.

To build upon this previous research we intend on incorporating design elements from the various papers. To ensure that our application is giving good real time interaction results we will use a predictive algorithm as was used in EEG-based continuous control of a game using a 3 channel motor imagery BCI [REF]. Our application will build on the ideas by simplifying the predictive algorithm to be used for broader state variables rather than precise motor controls. We will build upon BCI for Games by exploiting the popularity of gaming that it found to market a brain training exercise as a game first and foremost. Experiencing BCI Control in a Popular Game [REF] will be built upon by modifying the models for selecting an action based on input described in the paper to fit our own games control schematics.
