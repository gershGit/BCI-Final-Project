Our game focuses on self regulation as opposed to direct control over a specific action allowing for a broader use of the system we designed. Though our game is made to be entertaining such that the player wants to take part voluntarily, it can also be used for training. The extensibility of our project comes from the generic design rather than the specific implementation built. A more direct version of training could be built by encouraging the user to regulate only at specific times rather than having regulation result in a positive effect regardless of the scenario. This would help to ensure they are actually regulating when they mean to. This could be continued until training results in their ability to reactively regulate to high stress situations. Given research that uses driving games as a way to measure frustration[REF], the training could be tested by looking for a significant difference in their ability to regulate during the addition of the element intended to frustrate the user.
